# EchoVerse

**The Beginning of a Voice-Controlled Adventure**

EchoVerse is not just a game. It's the first spark of an immersive experience where voice becomes your controller, and reality blends with the virtual. This mini Python prototype marks the start of a larger journey into **voice-driven**, **interactive**, and eventually **augmented reality** storytelling.

## Vision

> One command at a time â€” build a world where your **voice shapes your path**.

This project will grow into:
- **A mobile-first voice adventure** (Android/iOS)
- **Virtual world interactions** through AR/VR
- **A real-time experience** where puzzles, exploration, and responses evolve with user voice input

---

## Current Prototype (Python Mini Game)

- Built in Python 3
- Recognizes simple voice commands
- Speaks back to the user using text-to-speech
- Serves as a proof-of-concept for hands-free gaming

---

## Technologies Used

- `speech_recognition`
- `pyttsx3`
- `pyaudio`

---

## How to Run

```bash
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
python echoverse.py
